# Who Are We

KATLAS is a UK Start-Up and our core focus is on healthcare – we offers a propriatory decentralised ledger technology (DLT) platform for enterprises  focused on the health industry looking to solve issues such as sharing private data across an organisation. In order to realise the promise of AI through accessing larger data sets where there are legal challenges, audit and transparency issues, our Digital Health Technology (DHT) is offers a patient healthcare wallet that enables patients to transact directly with disparate stakeholders on a peer-to-peer basis to achieve significant benefits in early diagnosis and preventative care.  We have a unique capability that is ready to deploy and commercially accessible to support enterprise transformation.

# Who is Our Target Customer

Healthcare as we are aware is a critical infrastructure service for all governments, to manage the wellbeing of their population, the biggest challenges faced today are political, financial and intraoperability.  

Our Target customer is the NHS where we believe that our tachnology can have the greatest impact. Customers are choosing our technology as unlike current centralised systems, that struggle with both privacy issues in the sharing of data and vulnerabitites in security from cyber attack, our platform puts the patient and end-users in control of their data and peace of mind in how the system stores data  efficaciously across a decentralised network. Our technology enhances planning by harnessing AI according to the highest ethical standards, and reduces the problems around identity, manual paper processes and ad hoc approaches to record-keeping on inconsistent systems.

# NHS Problems

The NHS simply does not have visibility of who, what where and when their services are being accessed, without which it is extremely difficult to allocate resources and measure effectiveness. The NHS 10 Year Health Plan provides guidance to digital health technology (DHTs) companies such as KATLAS to ensure our design and standards meet the necessary criteria, as set out by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in March 2019.

The massive waste and inertia from antiquated systems has resulted in patient consent forms and medical records that are incomplete, conflicting or ambiguous, and often replicated. The truth is, that we just don’t know what is being stored at huge expense, and is vulnerable to bad actors. However it has been recognized as a problem for some time. Initiatives have been in place for a number of years and budgets for innovation made available to standardize data, not only in the UK but also across the EU as part of their harmonized data planning. These standards are the bedrock on which better data management systems can be built. 


# How we Compare 

Unlike early blockchains such as Bitcoin, Corda and Hyperledger, our solution, is engineered from the ground up to meet modern enterprise requirements, including speed, performance and scalability, but most importantly a level of interoperability and versatility that will allow business leaders to add complexity and sophistication to their economic model over time and communicate in an unsiloed and effective fashion across departments. This will provide benefits to stakeholders along the supply chain.

Unlike current competitors where training, patches and high implementation costs are hampering adoption, our technology is hosted both securely and at low cost to implement and maintain. The biggest competition is the status quo. Current suppliers have the relationships and business knowledge of the problems that need to be solved whereas disruptive technology has to prove a stage jump in value as it is new poorly understood, treated with suspicion and largely untested. Gartner has recognised the lack of enterprise focus in the competitors of our technology.
We compete by offering test sandboxes, toolkits, education and entry level pricing.

Available blockchains are struggling to get past the initial POC stage where simple concepts have been demonstrated. Corda, one of the most advanced enterprise blockchains is too bespoke for scale and interoperability. KATLAS is unique in that it can demonstrate a design and capability in healthcare where the data challenges in terms of granular management, GDPR, KYC, performance, scale and interoperability are at their most profound. These are the leading testing grounds on which other use cases across a broad number of verticles will recognise and follow.

# Our Technology

KATLAS Technology, with its partners, with repect to healthcare will enable decision-makers to capture data from diagnostic equipment and patient wearable devices to serve the Real-Time Health Service goals. This will change the way patient and health data is collected, refined and uploaded to a decentralised data store for analysis or diagnosis, and then receive instructions or recommendations based on the patient’s specific needs.

KATLAS have designed an interface for an entirely new patient-centric experience, with a level of visibility and communication that supports the needs of healthcare stakeholders locally and nationally. The interface would allow a patient to monitor their health and wellbeing and provide a gateway to a host of services. 
Benefits to NHS long-term vision

KATLAS Technology will offer the technology platform, the demonstrators, toolkits and education programme; our partners with industry expertise and relationships will identify the business use case and manage the requirements gathering. 

Our technology is designed to support innovative economic models that meet the NHS 10yr Digital Health Plan as measured by the NICE effectiveness and economic impact criteria. We offer the latest and highest possible standards in User Experience by partnering with world leading expertise at The University of Westminster, to support a diverse and aging population with immobility and a other disadvantages.  

KATLAS will provide technology to industry suppliers that offer applications communicated through smart phones, home hubs, smart meters and medical devices. As such our economic model lends itself to simple subscription pricing mechanism either directly to users or by a licence to service providers (per user). 

In the health sector the market is potentially the world population, but not everyone has direct access to the infrastructure and supporting services, and not everyone needs access. Our services are inexpensive to deliver and are sufficiently versatile to allow differentiated pricing models without complicated or expensive maintenance. Auditability and fractionalization allows accounting to be consistent across a large ecosystem of disparate players. 

# In Summary

The KATLAS Technology Platform is an already fully functional and demonstrable decentralised technology stack. Our platform has evolved and through our dedicated business and development resources has been able to address the challenges that have plagued previous generations of blockchain platforms that were too slow, resource-intensive, specialised consensus algorithms and networks have resulted in scalability and performance problems. 

KATLAS Protocol has been built from the ground up to make the decentralised platform to support clients’ services, and is now choosing like-minded teams, people and organisations and academic universities to partner and integrate their value-added service capabilities into the core KATLAS platform.

Clients can select the options that they require to meet their expectations:

* A good concept-to-market capability and approach to work with clients to deliver customer value, and thus sustainable growth for their business 
* GTM strategy that is flexible in order to adapt to innovation types and market conditions
* Direct access to expert and proven delivery partners in the complex and opaque healthcare sector through our joint-venture with Correhealth
