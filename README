-------------------------------------------
If you are at master branch you should turn to your personal working branch, unless you master master-branch.
Check your current branch:
git branch
Turn to your branch (e.g. my branch)
git checkout marcos
(use your unix-like name (lowercase-nospaces) as your branch name.
If you don't have a branch create it now:
git checkout master #you want to branch from master
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>

After your firsh push you'll be asked to create a branch upstream, answer yes.

-----------------------------------------------

keep pulling and syncing with your peers.
git pull

git diff <peer-brach>
git merge <peer-branch>
